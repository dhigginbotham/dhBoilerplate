## dhBoilerplate 
I was tired of just copy and pasting out certain bits of apps I use for just about any and all Express apps.

I wouldn't recommend using this unless you have a good unstanding for it. I'll get to docs soon :)

### What it's got?
- Coffee-script 100%, submodules are usually compiled to js, but the core of the app is Coffee
- Passport (Local Strategy) w/ Mongoose
- Users / Auth routes w/ views and stuff
- Bootstrap 3.0
- Easy menus, assets, forms, and views as middleware.
- Various helpers I use a lot.

### What it doesn't have?
- a mess.
